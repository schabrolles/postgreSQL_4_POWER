+ About this repository
The purpose of this PPA is to provide access to the latest ubuntu postgresql packages for POWER Litlle-Endian architecture.
Source files used to build the packages comes from the official postgresql.org website (http://apt.postgresql.org) plus additional patches for optimization (like: 16MB hugepagesize support).

Note: We are currently working with the postgresql community to provide ppc64/ppc64le postgresql packages directly from their website (postgresql.org). This PPA will be closed when this will be officially done.
